# Frontend Mentor - Calculator app

![Design preview for the Calculator app coding challenge](./assets/calculator-app-main/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

This is a solution to the [Calculator app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/calculator-app-9lteq5N29) intermediate challenge on [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

My solution can be viewed on [https://fementor-calculatorapp.vercel.app/](https://fementor-calculatorapp.vercel.app/) and on my [Frontend Mentor profile](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/GreetVdL).

I implemented the calculating functionality by following my own logic and without looking at any tutorials or other people's code, so I am very pleased to nevertheless have been able to build a fully functional calculator.

The calculator displays results with a maximum of four digits after the comma.
Calculations with negative numbers are not possible.
